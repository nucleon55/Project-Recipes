    <p>Pizza is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeas</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>3 â…“ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
        <li>Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
    </ol>
